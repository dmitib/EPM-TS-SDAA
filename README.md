# Practical task repository for General Principles

## General Task Guidelines

*	Please fork the repository to your EPAM GitLab account and make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course .
*	It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
*	A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
*	While making changes, any files contained inside folder named as `thirdparty` should be ignored. These files are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
*	Some tasks have unit tests implemented (use `npm test` to run), if they exist, they are comprehensive, and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.
*   The goal is not to implement new features, but to refactor of existing code, according to principles you have just learnt. It is mean that all unit tests are green in the beginning, and they should remain green after you finish.
